For a composite primary key, you must provide both values for both the partition key and the sort key. If you specify any attributes that are part of an index key, then the data types for those attributes must match those of the schema in the table's attribute definition. Empty String and Binary attribute values are allowed. Attribute values of type String and Binary must have a length greater than zero if the attribute is used as a key attribute for a table or index. For more information about primary keys, see Primary Key in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide. Each element in the Item map is an AttributeValue object.
